# PinFit: Body Shape Detection Project

## üåü Overview
PinFit is a Python-based prototype that attempts to classify body shapes (Hourglass, Rectangle, etc.) by analyzing 2D skeletal keypoints from webcam images. Inspired by the vision of a personal fashion assistant, this project uses computer vision to estimate body proportions - with important limitations acknowledged.

> **"Innovation starts somewhere! This is Version 1: a skeletal-based classifier that gives a rough idea of body shape. Not flawless, but fabulous for a prototype."** üíÖ

## ‚ú® Features
- Real-time body shape classification via webcam
- Analysis of both front and side views for improved accuracy
- Skeletal keypoint detection using MediaPipe
- Simple visualization of detected body proportions
- Rough shape categorization (Hourglass, Rectangle, etc.)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations
This project has important technical constraints that users should understand:

1. **Not 3D Measurement**: 
   - Does not capture actual 3D body measurements
   - Only calculates ratios between 2D skeletal keypoints (shoulders, waist, hips)

2. **No Soft Tissue Detection**:
   - Cannot detect soft tissues or body volume with standard webcam
   - Classifications based on bone structure and positioning only
   - Labels like "bust" or "waist" are approximations, not medically accurate

3. **Hardware Constraints**:
   - Standard webcams cannot provide depth information
   - Requires specialized hardware (depth cameras, 3D scanners) for true volume analysis

## üöÄ Future Improvements
Planned enhancements to address current limitations:

1. **Depth Sensing Integration**:
   - Implement support for Azure Kinect or Intel RealSense
   - Capture actual 3D measurements for improved accuracy

2. **Advanced AI Models**:
   - Develop neural networks to infer body volume over time
   - Create more sophisticated classification algorithms

3. **Smart Mirror Vision**:
   - Evolve toward a "smart mirror" application for fashion and fitness
   - Real-time style recommendations based on accurate body analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup
